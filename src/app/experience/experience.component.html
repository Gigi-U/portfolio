    <p class="title">EXPERIENCE</p>
    <p class="description">
        With over two years of experience in software development, I've worked on a variety of projects both independently and collaboratively in teams. 
        <br>
        <br>
        As a backend developer, I've been involved in projects spanning different architectures, from monolithic applications to microservices, specializing in Java with Spring Boot. I've applied best practices in software development and have experience in application security using technologies like Spring Security, OAuth2, JWT, and Keycloak. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Additionally, I've acquired skills in unit and integration testing, as well as infrastructure management with Docker for secure application deployment. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In frontend development, I've worked with JavaScript and React to create interactive interfaces. Currently, I'm expanding my skills with Angular and TypeScript to stay up-to-date with emerging technological trends.
